If I look back on why I decided to start this program, there is not one 'a-ha' moment that lead me here. I think it was a lot of little things along the way. I have always been interested in technology and have had a natural curiosity about what makes it work. In that quest to learn more, I stumbled upon coding. 

I had never given it much thought until I purchased an Android phone. I wanted to customize it and make the background change colors with the sunrise and sunset. In order to do this I need to write a very simple line of code. If the time was between sunset and sunrise turn the background black and if it was between sunrise and sunset turn the back ground white. Pretty basic stuff, but enough to spark my curiosity. I thought what other things could I customize. I started to tweek my phone more and more. I set it to change the phone's wallpaper with the change in weather conditions. Each condition had a corresponding photo. 

From there I dabbled with some online coding class and attend a coding bootcamp. I finally decided to give it a real shot this spring. So here I am at the beginning...
