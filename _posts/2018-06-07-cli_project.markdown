I am going to say, first and foremost, that this project was quite difficult for me. Up to this point,  I have felt that my coding skills are not up to par. I often feel like someone who is looking at things through smoked glass. I know everything that is on the other side, but I just cannot bring it all into focus. Sometimes the learning curve can be painfully slow. 

For my CLI Project I decide to do a weather scraper. The program scrapes weather data based on a user's zip code. It then returns a list of weather options that they can choose from for a more detailed look at what is happening in their area. It is not the most complicated ever created, but I needed to keep it pretty straight forward because I was not confident in my abilities. Besides, there was no turning back now. 

I began my project with a full head of steam and actually finished the scraping portion of the project fairly quickly. Then life decided to rear its ugly head and keep me quite busy and my time to work on this project became few and far between. What are you going to do? Anyway, I kept chopping away at it and it slowly started to come together. I still struggle with collaborating objects, but I think it is starting to come into focus. For me the hardest part was dealing with github and my computer. It was so frustrating. I'll just say, after loads of online tutorials, I was able to get it to work.

From here, my plan is to keep reviewing the material that I have already covered until everything comes into focus. Good luck out there.
