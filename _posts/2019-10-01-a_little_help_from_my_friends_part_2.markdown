A few more keepsakes for those long nights...

[http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/](http://)
Interesting read on whether or not jquery is right for your project.

[http://1bestcsharp.blogspot.com/2017/04/javascript-add-edit-remove-table-row.html](http://)
A lot of good information about Javascript tables. Adding and removing items. Formatting rows, etc...

Traversy Media. i watched a ton of these videos. This guy really explains concepts well. They are easy to follow and build in complexity. I highly recommend.

Great video on how react-redux works. It really helps one grasp it conceptually.

Great videos on Ruby and Rails.

Well explained tutorials on React. Focusing on user authentication, sign up, and login.

There are a ton of great resources out there. These are just a few that helped me. I often find it helpful to get a few points of view when learning new concepts. Sometimes, I find that I need a second way of hearing new information so it will sink in. There is nothing more frustrating than not understanding a concept or idea. Hopefully these will help you to keep your chin up and have a few break throughs. 

Happy coding...
