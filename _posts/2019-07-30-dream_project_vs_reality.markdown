As I complete my rails.js project I am struck by one thing that continues to haunt my coding. Keeping it simple. I always start out with ambitious ideas and end up getting in my own way. My advice; get your app running and reliable like a Honda and then turn it into a Ferrari. If you try going the other way, you will quickly get in over your head. One piece at a time and every piece in it's place. Then, once the structure is solid, you can make it shiny and beautiful.
